         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N my opinion gentle Reader (which alſo is the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; writing of all the Philoſophers,) thoſe things are moſt principall to bee taught and maintained, which in the common wealth are moſt profitable and neceſſary, then may I ſay without iuſt cauſe of reproofe: if ſome thinke no ſhame to diſpleaſure many, for the pleaſuring of a few, then I neede not to bluſh, nor feare to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit many, by hurting of none, by the publiſhing of this my booke abroad: not pend without paine, nor drawne without diligence, nor ended with eaſe, wherein are ſuch and ſo many notable, rare, profitable, and precious things, as neuer were yet ſet forth in any volume in our Engliſh tongue, nay, diuers of them were neuer hetherto imprinted. Although I haue giuen the onſet to publiſh in our owne naturall tongue thys moſt excellent worke for all diſeaſes, for the which cauſe it ſhould not bee the leſſe eſteemed, although ſome, more curious then wiſe, eſteeme of nothing but that which is moſt rare, or in hard or vnknowne languages. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, theſe kinde of people cannot abide that good and lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Arts ſhould be common to many, fearing, that theyr name &amp; practiſe ſhould decay, or at the leaſt ſhould diminiſh: the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion truly of ſuch perſons, ſeemeth much like them that gape for all, and would all haue, leauing nothing to any body, but that which they muſt needes forgoe: not conſidering that we are not borne for our ſelues onely, as <hi>Plato</hi> ſayth, but for the profite of our Country. Surely, if I did not feare to be too long in thys my Praeface, I would proue, how all Arts and Sciences may be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in that tongue which is beſt to be vnderſtood, as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. <hi>Gallen</hi> the Prince of this Art, being a Grecian, wrote in the Greeke.

If then the intent of all that euer ſet forth any notable ſtudie, haue beene to be read of as many as would, what reaſon is it that we ſhould keepe ſecrete a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a few, the thing that was made to be common to all?

As for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of medicines, comfort of hearbs, maintenaunce of health, proſperitie and life, they be his benefits &amp; proceed of him, to the end that we ſhould in common helpe one another; and ſo to liue together in his Lawes and commaundements: deſiring all thoſe which ſhall find any fault herein, that they will friendly amend that is amiſſe.</p>
